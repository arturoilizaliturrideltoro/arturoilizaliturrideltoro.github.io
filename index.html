	  <p>Hystory:</p>
	  <p> Each year from June to May, the competition was created in the 1955-56 season under the name of the European Champion Clubs' Cup (original name in French, Coupe des Clubs Champions Européens), with a direct elimination format. In 1992 the tournament was restructured including for the first time the format of league competition in the quarterfinals phase, being renamed with its current name in the 1992/93 edition. Originally they classified to the contest the champions teams of the national leagues. In 1997 also began to participate the runners-up and in 1999 the classified until fourth place, depending on the UEFA coefficient of each league.
	    
	    The winner of this competition contests the European Super Cup and, as representative of the confederation, the FIFA Club World Cup. The current champion is Real Madrid Club de Fútbol, which won its eleventh title after beating Club Atlético de Madrid, 1 being also the club most laureate of the competition. Since the tournament has changed its name and structure, no club has achieved consecutive victories; Associazione Calcio Milan was the last team to revalidate its title, in the season 1989-90.
